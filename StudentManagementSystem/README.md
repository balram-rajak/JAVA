# Student Management System

## Description
A simple student management system that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java. The `Student` class encapsulates student data including name, roll number, and marks.

## Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation (private fields with public methods)
- Constructors
- Getter methods
- Instance methods

## Files
- `Student.java` - Student class definition

## How to Use
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Student.java
   ```

2. Create a main class or integrate into a larger application to use the Student class:
   ```java
   Student student = new Student("John Doe", 101, 85.5);
   student.displayInfo();
   ```

## Learning Objectives
- Understand class design and object creation
- Learn encapsulation principles
- Practice using constructors
- Work with getter methods and instance methods

## Future Enhancements
- Add a main class to manage multiple students
- Implement add, delete, and search functionality
- Store student data in files or databases
- Add grade calculation based on marks
