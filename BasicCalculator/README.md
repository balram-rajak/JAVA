A console-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user.

## Concepts Covered
- User input with `Scanner` class
- Switch statements
- Conditional logic
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling (division by zero)

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Calculator

Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15.0
```

## Learning Objectives
- Accept and process user input
- Implement switch-case statements
- Handle edge cases (division by zero)
- Work with different data types (double, char)
